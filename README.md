updating my knowledge/Skill in Java 8 until 17.

Since the release of version 8, up to version 17, Java is shaped by 194 JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), each of which brings some improvement to the platform. This page is a categorized and curated list of the most important improvements.

# Sealed Classes can restrict which other classes may extend them
* JDK 17 (Preview üîç in JDK 16 JDK 15)

```ruby
public abstract sealed class Shape
    permits Circle, Rectangle {...}

public final class Circle extends Shape {...} // OK
public final class Rectangle extends Shape {...} // OK
public final class Triangle extends Shape {...} // Compile error

// No need for default case if all permitted types are covered
double area = switch (shape) {
    case Circle c    -> Math.pow(c.radius(), 2) * Math.PI
    case Rectangle r -> r.a() * r.b()
};
```
* Pattern Matching for switch supporting type patterns and guarded patterns (Preview üîç) JDK 17

```ruby
String formatted = switch (o) {
    case Integer i && i > 10 -> String.format("a large Integer %d", i);
    case Integer i -> String.format("a small Integer %d", i);
    case Long l    -> String.format("a Long %d", l);
    default        -> o.toString();
};

```

* Record Classes, terse syntax to define immutable DTOs JDK 16

```ruby
record Point(int x, int y) { }
  
var point = new Point(1, 2);
point.x(); // returns 1
point.y(); // returns 2

```

* Pattern Matching for instanceof to eliminate the need for explicit casts after a type check JDK 16 (Preview üîç in JDK 15 JDK 14)

``` ruby
if (obj instanceof String s && s.length() > 5) {
    System.out.println("obj is a String with more than 5 characters: " + s.toUpperCase());
}
```

* Text Blocks JDK 15 (Preview üîç in JDK 14 JDK 13)

``` ruby

                    <p>Hello, world</p>
                </body>
            </html>
            """;
```

* Helpful NullPointerExceptions describing precisely which variable was null

      Cannot read field "c" because "a.b" is null

```


* Switch Expressions JDK 14 (Preview üîç in JDK 12 JDK 13)

      String s = day.toString();

HexFormat.of().toHexDigits(123);
//  ==> "0000007b"

# Summary


* JDK 8 was released in 2014. We had to wait for three and a half years for JDK 9. But since then things accelerated. Java has a new release structure that aims to deliver a new version in every six months. While Java 8 is still supported, migrating to the latest version brings considerable amount of improvements to the table.

* default and static methods in Interfaces
* Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions
* Optional
* Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections
* Java Time API
* Collection API improvements
* Concurrency API improvements
* Java IO improvements
    
    
 Let‚Äôs have a brief look on these Java 8 features. I will provide some code snippets for better understanding the features in a simple way.
 
    
* forEach()   
    
```ruby
 
public class Java8ForEachExample {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {         

        List<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        myList.add(10);
        myList.forEach(number -> System.out.println(number));
         
    } 
} 

```
* default and static methods in Interfaces

```ruby
public interface DefaultStaticExampleInterface {
   default void show() {
      System.out.println("In Java 8- default method - DefaultStaticExampleInterface");
   }
   static void display() {
      System.out.println("In DefaultStaticExampleInterface I");
   }
}
public class DefaultStaticExampleClass implements DefaultStaticExampleInterface {
}
public class Main {
   static void main(String args[]) {
      // Call interface static method on Interface
      DefaultStaticExampleInterface.display();
      DefaultStaticExampleClass defaultStaticExampleClass = new DefaultStaticExampleClass();
     
      // Call default method on Class
      defaultStaticExampleClass.show();
   }
}
```

* Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions
```ruby
@FunctionalInterface
interface Converter
{
   double convert(double input);
}

public class LambdaDemo
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      // Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
      System.out.println(convert(input -> (input-32)*5.0/9.0, 98.6));

      // Convert Kilometers to Miles
      System.out.println(convert(input -> input/1.609344, 8));
   }

   static double convert(Converter converter, double input)
   {
      return converter.convert(input);
   }
}

```

* Optional
```ruby
import java.util.Optional;  
public class OptionalExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        String[] str = new String[10];  
        Optional<String> checkNull = Optional.ofNullable(str[5]);  
        if(checkNull.isPresent()){  // check for value is present or not  
            String lowercaseString = str[5].toLowerCase();  
            System.out.print(lowercaseString);  
        }else  
            System.out.println("string value is not present");  
    }  
}  
```

* Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections
```ruby
import java.util.ArrayList; 
import java.util.List; 
import java.util.stream.Stream; 

public class StreamDemo{ 
    public static void main(String args[]) { 
        // Initialization of Collection 
        List<Order> orderBook = new ArrayList<>(); 
        Order buyGoogle = new Order("GOOG.NS", 300, 900.30, Order.Side.BUY); 
        Order sellGoogle = new Order("GOOG.NS", 600, 890.30, Order.Side.SELL); 
        Order buyApple = new Order("APPL.NS", 400, 552, Order.Side.BUY); 
        Order sellApple = new Order("APPL.NS", 200, 550, Order.Side.SELL); 
        Order buyGS = new Order("GS.NS", 300, 130, Order.Side.BUY); 
        orderBook.add(buyGoogle); orderBook.add(sellGoogle); 
        orderBook.add(buyApple); 
        orderBook.add(sellApple); orderBook.add(buyGS); 
        
        Stream<Order> stream = orderBook.stream(); 
    
        Stream buyOrders = stream.filter((Order o) -> o.side().equals(Order.Side.BUY)); 
        System.out.println("No of Buy Order Placed :" + buyOrders.count());
        
        Stream<Order> sellOrders = orderBook.stream().filter((Order o) -> o.side() == Order.Side.SELL); 
        System.out.println("No of Sell Order Placed : " + sellOrders.count());

        double value = orderBook.stream().mapToDouble((Order o) -> o.price()).sum();
        System.out.println("Total value of all orders : " + value);

        long quantity = orderBook.stream().mapToLong((Order o) -> o.quantity()).sum(); 
        System.out.println("Total quantity of all orders : " + quantity);

        
    } 

    
}

class Order {
    enum Side {
        BUY, SELL;
    } 
    private final String symbol; 
    private final int quantity; 
    private double price; 
    private final Side side; 

    public Order(String symbol, int quantity, double price, Side side) { 
        this.symbol = symbol; 
        this.quantity = quantity; 
        this.price = price; 
        this.side = side; 
    } 
    public double price() {
         return price; 
    } 
    public void price(double price) { 
        this.price = price; 
    } 
    public String symbol() { 
        return symbol; 
    } 
    public int quantity() {
         return quantity; 
    } 
    public Side side() { 
        return side; 
    }


}
Output: 
No of Buy Order Placed :3 
No of Sell Order Placed : 2 
Total value of all orders : 3022.6 
Total quantity of all orders : 1800

```
